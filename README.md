## Description

Creating READMe files can be time consuming and overly complicated at times. This application aimed to fix this issue by creating README files for any application from the command line. The user is prompted with questions about the application and their answers are added to a pre-formatted README file. This application can be reused for every project to quickly format such files and create professional and descriptive documentation.

## Installation

To install this application,  fork it from the github repository. Clone the starter code and add it to your computer and make sure Node.js is installed before running the application.

## Usage

To deploy the application cd into “./profesional_readme_generator/develop” and in the command line type “node index.js”. Answer the series of questions that will be displayed. Once complete, make sure that a README file has been added to the root directory of the application.
